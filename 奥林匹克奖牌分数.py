def numpy_dot():
    '''
    Imagine a point system in which each country is awarded 4 points for each gold medal,2 points for each silver meal,and one point
    for each bronze medal.
    Using the numpy.dot function,create a new dataframe called 
    'olympic_points_df' that includes:
        a)a column called called 'country_name' with the country name
        b)a column called 'points' with the total number of points the country earned at the Sochi olympics
    You do not need to call the function in your code when running it in the browser-the grader will do that automatically when you 
    submit or test it.
